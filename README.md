# Marco A. √Åmez personal web

## What is this

This is the work in progress of my basic personal web. You can see the distribution version in [this](https://github.com/Eucrow/amez.info.dist). repository.

As you can see, contains the package.json file of npm and the gulpfile.js of gulp. I use sass, so the sass files are also included in order to show to the world my increasing continuous knowledge of web develop :-).
